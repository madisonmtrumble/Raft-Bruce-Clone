# Raft-Bruce-Clone
Wanted to try out some AI/random selection stuff! This will move an enemy to a random object in the list. These objects have a health value and will eventually be 'killed' and removed from the list, continuing until the list is empty.

I made this in Unity and was only focusing on the code, so excuse the rudimentary assets!
